# FARM2FORK
FARM2FORK is a project built around a simple idea: reducing the distance between farmers and consumers.

In the current food supply chain, produce often passes through multiple intermediaries, which affects pricing, freshness, and transparency. This project explores how technology can be used to make the journey from farm to fork more direct, fair, and traceable.

The aim of FARM2FORK is to give farmers better visibility and control over their produce while helping consumers understand where their food comes from. The project focuses on improving transparency in sourcing, minimizing unnecessary middle layers, and encouraging sustainable agricultural practices.

This repository contains the implementation and supporting materials developed as part of an academic project. The work is exploratory and intended for learning and research purposes, with scope for further extension.
